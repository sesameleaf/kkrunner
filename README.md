# K.K. Runner
This is a Gameboy Advance game created in C with handdrawn sprites and animations. In the game, you play as Bob (the lazy, purple cat) from Animal Crossing. You're being chased by a swarm of bees and have to jump over obstacles (rocks) and catch bugs for as long as you can. Use the LEFT, RIGHT, and UP keys to maneuver Bob. Use the A button to catch bugs. If you manage to catch three bugs, you'll activate the cheat.

### Running the Game
